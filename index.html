	<h1>Look Out, World!</h1>
	<h3>Applications Developer looking for an internship</h3>

	<p>Laura Pak, junior computer science student at the University of Texas at Dallas--I'm very pleased to meet you!</p>
	<p>I can code in Python3, C++, JSX, Java, and I can mock up a webpage in HTML5 and CSS. I have brushed on the basics of SQL, but it is the least strong of my languages.</p>
	<p>I use React Native a lot to build mobile apps that will work on Android and iOS. I also code in vim; I'm planning to switch soon, but I am familiar with bash command line as a result of the vim experience. I access Github and use git with the command line--at this point, I don't think I could learn Github Desktop.</p>
	<p>Least excitingly, I am proficient in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Google Drive.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>In addition to mobile apps coded in React Native (for elementary kids' math, volunteer housing in case of natural disaster or emergency, quick calulation of casing for oil wells), I have contributed to Social Media Stocker, a website that uses machine learning and social media to predict stock prices, and Clean Green, a game that educates the player on recycling and conservation.</p>
	<p>My current project is a website that uses machine learning to predict which tennis player will win the ATP tournament. Another project in the works is a mobile app that will allow people to quickly check if a dog is a stray or a lost pet.</p>
